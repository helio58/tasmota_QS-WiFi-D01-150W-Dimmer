# tasmota_QS-WiFi-D01-150W-Dimmer
Compiled file use it at own risk
8.1
Tasmota_8.1_script.bin works but I have just tested
Tasmota_8.1wifi_dimmerscript_enable.bin is smaller.
As said use it at own risk.
Used templete from this page https://templates.blakadder.com/qs-wifi_D01_dimmer.html
The script I used is from https://github.com/sqw534/QS-Wifi-D01-Tasmota ,
